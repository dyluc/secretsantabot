# secretsantabot
A Python email bot to generate Secret Santa matches.

Before running, modify the files inside /res:

+ **emails.txt** should contain a list of names and matching email addresses.
+ **message.txt** should contain a pre-written message with two separate tags. **{to}** representing the person to be addressed, and **{ss}** representing their Secret Santa match.
+ **sender.txt** should contain the login information of the sender email address.
